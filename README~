STOCHASTIC INTEGRATOR : EXPLICIT EULER METHOD

========================================

This is the README file for my C++ programs that implement a stepper to perfom stochastic integration using explicit Euler method.
The codes uses some of the packages from the BOOST library.

Included are three header files:

1. boost_random.hpp : This header file creates the required class for generating random numbers using the BOOST library
2. det_model_hh_post.hpp : header file containing the HH neuron class. This is similar to the classical HH implementaion 
3. stoch_odeint_explicit_euler.hpp : header file contains the implementaion of stochastic integrator class using explicit_euler method

Also included is the below named 'main' function that demonstrates how to use the program

1. test_stoch_euler.cpp
